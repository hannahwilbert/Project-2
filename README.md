# Project-2

GigEquipt is a simple application that performs CRUD operations to a mySQL database via JawsDB deployed on heroku.

Retrieves data from the database (Equiptment List), Updates the value of the equiptment when packed, creates equiptment (What equiptment do you need?), and deleted all data from the database (Clear all) using the ORM Sequelize.
